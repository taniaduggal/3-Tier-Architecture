## Web Tier

A presentation or web tier is the user interface and communication layer of an application.
This is where the end-user will interact with the application. It will display information and
collect information.

## Application Tier

The logic or application tier is the heart of the architecture. It’s where information is
cessed. This tier contains all the business logic used to process inputs. It can direct queries,
use API calls, process information and commands, make logical decisions, and perform calculations. It moves and processes information to the other layers.

## Database Tier

This is where information will be stored and managed.

## Pre-requisites:
